# Welcome to The Shoppies!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is hosted at https://irosen419.github.io/the_shoppies/

## To start:

You will need to get a free API key from http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx
Once you have an api key, create an env file in the root directory with

### `touch .env`

Inside the file type 'REACT_APP_API_KEY = {api key goes here}
Note: You must deliminate each word in the variable name with an underscore ('_')

In the project directory, run: 

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
The page should open in automatically in the browser, if not...
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

When the application loads, type any movie title into the search bar.
As you type, the app will search the OMDB's API for movies containing your input and display them in the the results bucket.
You may nominate a movie for a Shoppy by clicking the 'Nominate' button.
If you made a mistake and the movie is actually unworthy of a nomination, you may click the 'Remove Nomination' button to remove it from the nominations bucket.

You can also filter through more results by click the 'Next Page' or 'Previous Page' buttons and visit a movie's IMDB page by clicking the link provided.

Happy Shoppy-ing!
